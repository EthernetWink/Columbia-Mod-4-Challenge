# Columbia-Mod-4-Challenge

From the csv file in the Resources folder I read in data with pandas and due financial calculation with it.

I view the performance, volatility, and risk of the 4 funds and S&P 500 with python.

# Performance

To analyze performance I use the cummuative product of all the information I have and view the results.

# Volatility 

To view volatility I view the funds returns as a box plot to see which ones had the widest range

# Risk

For risk I use standard deviation and rolling windows to determine the risk of a fund over a period of time

# Risk to Return

I then calculate Sharpe ratios for all the funds and S&P 500

# Diversity

Finally I use variance and the mean to see which funds were most correlated to the S&P 500
